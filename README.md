Journal Entries!

By Cydney, Mia, Joseph, and Ayan

In our final project, we made an app that allows the user to write in a virtual journal! Our project will allow the user to release stress and express their emotions and feelings in the form of writing. The user can view their latest entry, while also seeing all of the entries they've made over time. Some features we'd like to add in the future are allowing the user to edit their entries. Another feature would be letting the user choose the font they wish to write in. Overall, we all worked hard on this project and we hope you enjoy it!
